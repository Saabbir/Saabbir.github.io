## JSON in JavaScript

JSON isn't really a part of JavaScript. It's a subset of JavaScript. Stands for JavaScript object notation. Because it's inspired by JavaScript object literal syntax. Anything that is valid JSON is also valid JavaScript object literal syntax but not all object literal syntax is valid JSON. In JSON, properties have to be wrapped in quotes.
